# QuizGaming

This is a code for a java quiz having two main featues - Teachers and Students, where teacher can make any changes such as( add, delete , update) courses according to them. Teachers can also create quiz and all details of different teachers are also stored in a .dat file. Details of students are also stored similarly. The quiz created is stored in a text file. 

I have used Java as a language to create the quiz. All the basic concepts of OOPs's such as Polymorphism, File Handling and also Interfaces are used. The basic principle of OOAD are used for clean designing that is SOLID.
